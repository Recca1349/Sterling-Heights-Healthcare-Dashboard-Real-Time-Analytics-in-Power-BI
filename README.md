## Description
This is designed and developed comprehensive Power BI dashboard for Sterling Heights Hospital, a mid-sized healthcare facility seeking to improve operational oversight and patient-centered care. The dashboard provides real-time insights into patient visit patterns, treatment categories, doctor availability, and satisfaction metrics. By transforming raw hospital data into actionable visuals, this solution supports informed decision-making, optimizes staff allocation, and enhances visibility into key performance indicators across departments. The project highlights my ability to apply data analytics and visualization techniques to address real-world challenges in the healthcare sector.
